1. Install the Memory Monitor on Windows. It located under the "../Memory Monitor/Installer/.." folder.
   If you have installed the LabVIEW 2016 or its runtime engine. you can open the Memory Monitor.exe under the "../Memory Monitor/Executable/.." folder.

2. Process Name control is optional, if you let the name control empty, Memory Monitor will monitor the LabVIEW and TestStand Memory usage.
   You can also fill the name with the process name you want to monitor.
   Memory Monitor sets the default sampling interval as 3 seconds and the default log file path as "D:\log.csv". You can modify them as you desired.

3. If there is no memory leak in the LabVIEW VI/application or TestStand sequence, when you stop the LabVIEW VI/application or TestStand sequence, the
   final memory used value should be equal to the inital value. 

4. When you click the STOP button, the Memory Monitor will stop recording. You can check the log file to view the result.
